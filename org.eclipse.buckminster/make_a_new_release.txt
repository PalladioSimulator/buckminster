This is most definitively a work in progress.

This procedure should be updated as we go along - currently there are
deficiences in both Buckminster, Eclipse, somewhere in between, CVS maturity as
a CM tool, processes etc etc, that all makes this less enjoyable than it could
be. We're far away from the ideal press-a-single-button. So, currently, this is
just a procedure that works (and is essentially repeatable which is what I'm
really after at this point). And note that this is really about doing a 'spnnn'
release - a new milestone or actual bona fide release has some differences that
I can think of from the top of my head.

1) You need a FRESH Eclipse instance!
Ensure you have an uptodate workspace. There are two ways to go about this:
	a) Either it is constructed with your normal Eclipse instance in which you
	have installed a previous Buckminster and using that, you have used the
	dogfooding instructions tp get a working workspace.
	b) If you don't have access to an update site with an earlier Buckminster
	version, or you have other reasons to start from complete scratch, please
	see the document 'bootstrap_buckminster_build.txt'.
Now close the 'full' instance and start another one - you need one that is
basic 3.2M2 or above plus a Subclipse installation (from
http://subclipse.tigris.org/update). It must *NOT* have Buckminster installed.
NOTE: This is because Eclipse finds the installed Buckminster features/plugins
rather than give preference to the workspace ones. Once we have proper version
dependencies this should go away.

====================================

2) Update all feature projects
Currently there are 6 'normal' features:
	org.eclipse.buckminster.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.headless.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.p4.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.p4.ui.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.svn.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.ui.feature
Open feature.xml in each:
* Overview tab: set 'Version:' to an appropriate value (e.g. '1.0.0.M1sp002')
* Plug-ins tab: press 'Version...' and force the feature version into the
referenced plugins

There are also 2 'special' features (used for properly putting the product
together):
	org.eclipse.buckminster.headless.platform.feature
	org.eclipse.buckminster.product
Open feature.xml in each:
* Overview tab: set 'Version:' to an appropriate value (e.g. '1.0.0.M1sp002')

Finally, the org.eclipse.buckminster.product needs some extra attention:
	1. It includes several features rather than depend on them. This means that
	it references several features by name and version, and that version thus
	needs to be updated. I've found the easiest way to do this is to open the
	feature.xml in source mode and manually edit the version attribute in the
	<includes> tags.
	2. The '...product' file needs to be checked so that it references itself
	with the new version (the configuration tab). If this is not set, the 
	product build doesn't fail, it just produces a zip file that is very small.
====================================

3) Build the update site
* Site Map tab: use 'Add feature...' to add the 5 normal features. Depending on
focus they might be sorted into either one of the categories or outside both of
them. Move them (drag'n'drop') to the correct category:
	core:
		org.eclipse.buckminster.feature
		org.eclipse.buckminster.ui.feature
	optional:
		(the others)
NOTE: leave the existing feature references in the categories (i.e. for
1.0.0.M1, 1.0.0M1sp001 etc). They don't exist in your workspace, but by leaving
them in the site.xml, the file can simply be uploaded and still correctly
reference the ones that already are on the download site.
* Site Map tab: press 'Build all'. With a bit of luck all goes splendid and you
end up with two new directories inside the project: 'features' and 'plugins'
(these should not be checked in so there's a .cvsignore there...).
NOTE: well, this can go bust for build related reasons, especially since it's
doing some fancy Ant stuff behind the scenes which we don't normally do.

====================================

4) Build 'org.eclipse.buckminster.product'
Open 'buckminster.product' (the actual file):
* Overview tab: under 'Exporting' use the link to 'Eclipse Product Export
Wizard' to start the wizard dialog. Unless the normal dialog defaults are
changed by Eclipse, they are mostly ok, but the 'Root directory:' should be
'buckminster'. Also, select 'Archive file:' as destination and fill in the
name. I've used the convention 'buckminster.product-1.0.0.M1sp002.zip' so
specify it to be put in some convenient location. Click Finish. As for the
update site, this can break for various build related issues that we don't
normally see.

====================================

5) Prepare a 'mini-site' to test from
The objective here is to create a little tree that later, if all's well, can be
uploaded as is and nicely blend with what's already there. So, pick a spot and
create a spanking new directory. Inside that directory there should be three
directories named:
	archivedsites
	products
	updates
* Beginning from the back, into 'updates', copy from the
org.eclipse.buckminster.updates project:
	site.xml
	site.properties
	features
	plugins
* Into 'products' copy the created product zip.
* Into 'archivedsites' should go a zipped copy of the stuff under 'updates'
(exactly - thus the top level in the zip should contain the site.xml etc). The
name of the finished zip should follow the convention
'buckminster.archivedsite-1.0.0.M1sp002.zip'.

====================================

6) Test
Do the usual smoke tests - fresh eclipse, install Subclipse and install
Buckminster from the update site, try build_a and dogfooding etc.
Here things can be horribly wrong because of some nasty build issue not seen
before.

====================================

7) Check changes in and tag
Commit, select *all* projects and run Team/Tag using the proper form for the
tag, e.g. 'v1_0_0_M1sp002'.

====================================

8) Upload
Connect to dev.eclipse.org with for example WinSCP. Everything goes
under/home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster.
NOTE: this area is not directly visible, it'll take time to stage to the real
download location at download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster (minutes, I
think). Then, it will stage to mirrors (no idea how long it takes).

====================================

9) Announce
If it's suitable, update the web pages in some manner and announce it on news.
