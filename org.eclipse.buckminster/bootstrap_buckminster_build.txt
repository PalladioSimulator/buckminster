This document describes how to create a workspace that is suitable for building
a Buckminster update site + product as described in 'make_a_new_release.txt'
and you are armed with only a basic Eclipse installation (in this document,
Eclipse 3.2 M2 was used).

Normally Buckminster needs Buckminster to build, but the procedure described
below can be necessary if you don't have access to a prior Buckminster release
that you can install, or if there are other reasons such an installation is
unsuitable.

1) Make sure Subclipse is installed.
Use Help/Software updates/Find and Install/Search for new features to install.
Add a new remote site: 'http://subclipse.tigris.org/update', and make sure it's
checked before Finish. Install and restart.

2) Retrieve the individual components from CVS by using the bootstrap.psf file 
(import team project set). When completed, the org.eclipse.buckminster.core
indicates build problems - this is normal.

3) Download external dependencies from a Maven repository.
The org.eclipse.buckminster.core component depends on two jar files normally
downloaded by Buckminster from a maven repository: log4j and tada-sax.
	a) Download 'http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/log4j/jars/log4j-1.2.9.jar' and
	   place it as '<workspace>/org.eclipse.buckminster.core/jars/log4j.jar'
	b) Download 'http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/se.tada/jars/tada-sax-0.2.0.jar'
	   and place it as
       '<workspace>/org.eclipse.buckminster.core/jars/tada-sax.jar'
Note that version information is stripped from the jar names.

4) Refresh the org.eclipse.buckminster.core component and make it build.
	a) First refresh the entire workspace
	b) Open the org.eclipse.buckminster.core project properties
	   Select the 'Java Build Path' and the 'Libraries' tab. Use 'Add JARs...'
	   to add the two jar files under 'jars'.
	c) Trigger a full build by 'Project/Clean.../Clean all projects'.
	   When the build is complete, there should be no build errors present (but
	   possibly some minor build warnings).
	   
5) Run Ant script in org.eclipse.buckminster.ant.
Open the org.eclipse.buckminster.ant/make folder, and right-click on
'build.xml'. Select 'Run As.../Ant build...'. Select the 'Classpath' tab. Click
on 'User Entries' and then on 'Add External JARs...'. Navigate to the Eclipse
instance you are running and in 'plugins', find and select
'org.eclipse.ant.core_3.1.0.jar' and 'org.eclise.core.runtime_3.1.0.jar'. Now
'Apply' and 'Run'. This should report a 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL' Ant run.

6) Run Ant script in org.eclipse.buckminster.pde.
Repeat instructions in #5 for this component but here add the following jars:
	org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.1.0.jar
	org.eclipse.core.resources_3.1.0.jar
	org.eclipse.jdt.core_3.1.0.jar
	org.eclipse.pde.core_3.1.0.jar

7) You should now be able to build an update site from the workspace. In
principle, follow the 'make_a_new_release.txt' instructions (but you should be
able to stay with the Eclipse instance you already have running in this case).
