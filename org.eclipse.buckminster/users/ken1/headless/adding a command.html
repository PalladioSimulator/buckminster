  <title>adding a command</title>

<body>
Not surprisingly, the framework deals with making it possible to add a new command, for example 'helloworld', so you can write<br>
<br>
buckminster helloworld<br>
<br>
The name, an optional namespace (in addition to the plugin namespace,
which is always prefixed to the name) and 0-M aliases are declared in
the extension point along with an implementation class. The
implementation class must derive from the base class AbstractCommand.
In principle, only the method 'run' needs to be overridden, but likely
you wish to override others, for example to declare option support and
callbacks for detection of them. Also, the declaration can tag the
command as 'hidden' (works, but not shown on listings) or 'disabled'
(doesn't work). Finally, you may indicate whether the framework should
automatically add support for the option flags '-?'/'--help'
(recommended).<br>
<br>
Assuming the framework manages the help options, you should add a file
with the same name as the command class name, but with a '.help'
extension with the help text.<br>
<br>
As noted, the long name of a command is always prefixed with the plugin
id. Thus, a plugin with the id 'org.somedomain.plugin' declaring a
command with the name 'helloworld' and alias 'hw' will in reality be
known as 'org.somedomain.plugin.helloworld' and
'org.somedomain.plugin.hw'. As another example, the name can contain
further namespace levels - e.g. 'my.name.space.helloworld', leading to
'org.somedomain.plugin.my.name.space.helloworld'. However, note that
any aliases do&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> contain a namespace - they will just work in the same namespace as the main/real name.<br>
<br>
Commands are supposed to cooperate with some settings&nbsp;supplied by
the framework (which may be reflections of user selections): currently
this deals with a suggested location for storing tmp files, and an
implementation of progress monitor to provide to lower layers. See the
'context' for details.<br>
<br>
Commands can typically write freely to System.out and System.err. Note
that both or either may have been trapped by the frameworks logging
mechanism.<br>
