Buckminster is available in two distribution formats.<br>
<ul>
  <li>As an Eclipse Update site<br>
This is obviously the main format: a set of features where each in turn
consists of one or many plugins. It is convenient to use; all you need
to do is point the Update Manager to the site and select the features
you wish to install. However, to use it fully you need to have the
Eclipse IDE already installed, and not be overly concerned with disk
space requirements for example. By installing features into the IDE you
automatically gain both the regular graphical UI based interaction
mechanisms as well as the <a href="headless.html">Headless</a> command
framework. No extra work by the user is required to make this
functional; it will automatically initialize itself when the IDE starts
(such as when restarting after a feature installation). The Buckminster
features/plugins have been carefully designed to avoid dependencies on
UI packages when not required so as to be possible to use even in
environments where it's not possible to use a&nbsp; graphical UI. In
such situations it may make more sense to use the <a href="#As_an_Eclipse_Product">product build</a>.<br>
The Buckminster update site is located at&nbsp;<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/updates">http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/updates</a>. If you wish to download a zip archive of &nbsp;the update site (for a given version x.y.z.dt), such are available in <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/archivedsites">http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/archivedsites</a> (for example as buckminster.archivedsite-x.y.z.dt.zip).<br>
  </li>
  <li><a name="As_an_Eclipse_Product"></a>
As an Eclipse Product<br>
This format is for&nbsp;specialized situations; it is called the
'product' format as it is built using the Eclipse Product packaging
paradigm. Beyond the fact that is intended as a standalone package, you
can view it as a subset of the functionality gained through the update
site. Specifically, it is intended to be used in <a href="headless.html">Headless</a>
mode situations only (though given it's design it can serve as a
foundation for achieveing a graphical startup as well). It only
contains the bare essentials to begin with, so before it can be used
for anything useful, it needs to be <a href="product.html">customized</a>
by you. The benefit is that you can be very selective on what it
contains, and thus bring down the disk requirements. Actually, it is
likely you may wish to use install further Buckminster features from
the Buckminster update site.<br>
Product builds are available as zip archives (for a given version x.y.z.dt) in <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/products">http://download.eclipse.org/technology/buckminster/products</a> (for example as buckminster.product-x.y.z.dt.zip).</li>
</ul>
Note that Buckminster has many possible extension points. This is also true for the <a href="headless.html">Headless</a>
framework. In fact, it is entirely possible to use this framework only
and produce your very own headless application which has nothing to do
with what Buckminster can do otherwise. More on extending the Headless
framework <a href="headless%20integration.html">here</a>.
