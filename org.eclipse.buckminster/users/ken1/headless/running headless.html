<p class="MsoNormal">An Eclipse based application is generally installed in a
(root) directory &ndash; typically a directory called &lsquo;eclipse&rsquo; when getting the IDE
and &lsquo;buckminster&rsquo; for the Buckminster product &ndash; for simplicity here, let&rsquo;s
refer to it as &lsquo;c:\eclipse&rsquo; as on a typical Windows machine (NB: Buckminster is
intended to work the same on a Unix/Linux platform).<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">When installing Buckminster in the IDE, Buckminster will place a
few extra files in this directory to accommodate the Buckminster command line
entry point (the launcher). In particular, there will be an executable called
&lsquo;buckminster&rsquo; there (i.e. buckminster.exe on Windows).<br>
<br>
When installing a Buckminster product derivative, the buckminster
binary and others are likely already in place and you need to do
nothing. The party who is doing the customization however, can read
more <a href="product.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A
simple way is then to
set your PATH to point to the directory &ndash; we&rsquo;ll assume this
to here and elsewhere to avoid cluttering the examples. Other
possibilities is to use a command shell alias mechanism, or plain
simply always invoke things with the full path.<br>
</span>

<h3>The 'buckminster' command</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">So the way to reach Buckminster commands from the
command line is through one primary entry point - the 'buckminster'
binary (for other possibilities, see <a href="entrypoints.html">here</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interacting with Buckminster headless should be simple and look and work&nbsp;like just any other command line application:</p>






<pre>c:\tmp&gt;buckminster<br>No command provided. Try 'buckminster -?'.</pre>

Not very exciting - let's move on.<br>
<br>
The buckminster command is built up to work similarly to
many others: as an argument it takes a command name which is what is actually
invoked. Compare for example to CVS commands. In this vein, the launcher
&lsquo;buckminster&rsquo; acts as a context &amp; framework for each installed command.
And, the launcher can itself be tailored to customize behavior and context for
the actual command (using flags), while each command can itself have its own
set of flags. In short, it looks like this:



<pre>buckminster &lt;commonflags&gt; &lt;commandname&gt; &lt;commandflags&gt;<br></pre>
<p>The flags (both the common flags and the command flags) loosely follow the basic GNU convention of
allowing either short flags using one dash and one letter, or long flags using
two dashes and a (possibly abbreviated) long name. A common theme is that both buckminster
and all individual commands (encouraged but not enforceable though) understands
and acts on &lsquo;-?&rsquo;/&rsquo;&mdash;help&rsquo; to provide basic help text. The common flags are described <a href="Common%20flags.html">here</a>.</p>
There are also a set of core commands to make possible the minimum -
e.g. installing a feature from an update site. More on this <a href="Core%20commands.html">here</a>.
<h3>Command naming structure</h3>




<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Since it&rsquo;s possible to extend the commands available,
Buckminster uses the plugin naming hierarchy together with the actual command
name to avoid collisions. But, to avoid a user having to type the full
structure every time, Buckminster will always try to match a command name to
the shortest possible. It is also possible to assign any number of alias names
to any command. An example is the &lsquo;listprogressmonitor&rsquo; command that in reality
is &lsquo;org.eclipse.buckminster.headless.listprogressmonitor&rsquo; - it can also be
reached through the alias &lsquo;lspm&rsquo; (with or without the naming hierarchy).</span>

<br>
<br>
A tip to script writers is to always use the full name in scripts -
this will avoid surprises if suddenly another dynamically installed
plugin also uses the same base name for a command, hence generating an
error when the short name becomes ambiguous.<br>
