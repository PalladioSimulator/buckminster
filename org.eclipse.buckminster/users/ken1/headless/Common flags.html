  <title>Common flags</title>
</head>


<body>


Buckminster headless has a set of flags applicable to the basic
entrypoint, rather than an individual command. They essentially
influence the context in which the commands run and/or provide a
meta-way to customize the startup.<br>


<br>


The available flags can be roughly
divided into a couple of groups:

<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Workspace
     management</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Logging</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">User
     interaction</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">JVM
     specialization</li>


</ul>


Below follows an introduction to what the various flags do. See the --help for more details at this point.

<h3><o:p></o:p>Workspace management</h3>






<p class="MsoNormal">As Buckminster at its heart uses the Eclipse framework, this
exhibits itself in a couple of ways. One of these ways is that an ingrained
concept is to work with a &lsquo;workspace&rsquo;, just like the Eclipse IDE does.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As it happens, the location of this workspace must
be set very early in the lifecycle of an Eclipse application, and this is thus
the interface to it. The flag(s) are either &lsquo;-W&rsquo; or &lsquo;&mdash;workspace&rsquo; and should
point to a directory (automatically created if not existing). By default, a
workspace called &lsquo;workspace&rsquo; will be used (created when first referenced)&nbsp;in the user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>






<h3>Logging</h3>






<p class="MsoNormal">Buckminster internally has a logging system. This is clearly
visible when in the IDE (from the preferences pages). From the command line
there are a number of flags to control logging behavior. A basic idea is that
Buckminster goes to some lengths to trap writes to System.out/err as
well as the Eclipse internal log, and to do so in a synchronous fashion with
specific log writes. A full log from a run which mysteriously fails will help a
great deal in isolating the problem in an &lsquo;after-the-fact&rsquo; fashion.</p>






<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">-L<br>



     --log<br>



     This is the most basic of the logging flags &ndash; they turn on logging
     directly to stdout.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--logtofile<br>



     This turns on logging to a log file. Using &lsquo;&mdash;appendtolog&rsquo; will turn on
     append mode.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--[no]trapouttolog<br>



     --[no]traperrtolog<br>



     --[no]trapeclipselogtolog<br>



     Turns on or off trapping of System.out/err, Eclipse log. Default, they are all turned on.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--trapoutloggername<br>



     --traperrloggername<br>



     --trapeclipselogloggername<br>



     --logconfiguration<br>



     Buckminster (currently) uses Log4J as its engine. This advanced capability
     can be used to customize the actual logging configuration used.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--nobootlog<br>


The <a href="booting.html">boot</a> process is somewhat convoluted so
by default the launcher logs what it is doing and later provides this
information to the finished application so it can be channeled to the
'real' log. This information is crucial to understand exactly how the
app was started. Using this options turns this off logging off. Note
that the '--boottrace' flag differs from this - tracing is always done
straight to stdout and may be necessary to debug the boot (logging)
itself... </li>


</ul>




<h3><o:p></o:p>User interaction</h3>








<p class="MsoNormal">There are some aspects that touches on how the user sees the
results etc of running commands.<br>


<o:p></o:p></p>




<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--displaystacktrace<br>



     This option can be given if the user desires a full stack trace printout
     in case of actual code problems &ndash; normally it just prints a less daunting
     problem report if that happens. Regular &lsquo;errors&rsquo; (e.g. bad usage of flags or similar
     should obviously be reported to the user in a more understandable manner).</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--[no]progress<br>



     --progressconfiguration<br>



     Ingrained into the Eclipse architecture is frequent use of an abstract
     &lsquo;progress monitor&rsquo;. Normally, there are various implementations for this
     available when using the GUI &ndash; dialogs with progress bars etc. In a
     command line setting though, all we have to work with is essentially
     stdout. So, the Buckminster framework provides (at least one) progress
     monitor implementation that gives a credible representation on stdout.
     Which implementation is chosen is defined by the user and thus transparent
     to the individual commands. By default it&rsquo;s turned on using a default
     implementation. The configuration flag allows a user to switch
     implementations, and/or configure the selected progress monitor itself.<br>


This is an extension point and new monitors can thus be added. Note
that it is up to a command to actually use the implementations here -
internally the command must request a monitor from 'the context'.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--tmpdir<br>



     Occasionally, the framework and/or a command needs to use temporary files.
     This is just a convenient way for a user to express a desire to steer such
     tmp files to a specific location. It is up to a command to use this
     information.</li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--notrapctrlc<br>
By default, Buckminster attempts to trap Ctrl-C. This trapping can be
turned off entirely with this flag. The reason for trapping Ctrl-C is
that, since below the Eclipse
framework may be active doing something to the workspace or other
managed resource when Ctrl-C is pressed. Since Ctrl-C will by default
simply interrupt the application and exit, this can occur such that the
workspace is left in an inconsistent state. This is frequently less of
a problem when using the IDE since a user has to knowingly kill the
entire process. Instead, the Ctrl-C trap tries to send proper 'cancel'
requests to known/active progress monitors which should cause the code
using those monitors to cleanly exit. In case this still doesn't work,
see --ctrlcforceexitcount for a way out.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--ctrlcforceexitcount<br>
In case an app doesn't cleanly exit, pressing Ctrl-C repeatedly will
exit the VM anyway. This flag allows specifying the number of required
Ctrl-C presses for this to happen. Defaults to 5.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--boottrace<br>



     This is normally used for solving problems with the launcher but may be
     important to understand how a given sequence of JVM arguments are passed
     on &ndash; see below.</li>


</ul>




<h3><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>JVM specialization

</h3>


Buckminster is a Java application, and thus needs a JVM. By
default, Buckminster will be started assuming the regular operating system
command &lsquo;java&rsquo; works. There are two reasons why this may not be adequate:
either the JVM selected by that command is not the one wanted, and/or the user
wants to pass in flags intended for the JVM (e.g. manipulating the memory
sizes).<o:p><br>


&nbsp;</o:p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="disc">


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--vm<br>



     This can be used to specifically select a JVM.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--vmarg<br>



     This can be used to send flags to the VM to run. This flag works a bit
     unusually in that it is important to use it in the correct sequence. Also,
     to minimize issues where command line escaping must be used, one &ndash;vmarg
     per actual argument must be used, and they will internally be reformatted
     to be actual flags to the JVM. To understand this process the &ndash;boottrace
     flag may be useful.</li>


  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">--forcenewvm<br>



     If the launcher finds that it must start a new VM to accommodate the
     &ndash;vm/--vmarg flags used, it will do so, otherwise it will attempt to run in
     the same VM as the launcher. If necessary a new VM can be forced,
     regardless.</li>


</ul>
