<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">There may be occasions where a full
Eclipse IDE installation is deemed overkill or just plain is too big (the
various features incorporated in the IDE download sometimes contain a lot more
than is actually needed). In such cases it would be attractive with something
minimal, which can be configured exactly as needed by a workgroup and contain
no more and no less than what is required. In the best case this can bring down
the size required to less than 10% of the IDE installation side (or even more
by hand pruning the result).<br>


<br>


</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To accomplish this, Buckminster has an alternate
packaging mechanism using the technique of creating an &lsquo;Eclipse product&rsquo;, i.e.
using parts of the regular Eclipse framework to create a freestanding
application that in no way resembles the IDE. So, only a few Eclipse plugins is
in there, and just the core of Buckminster. Currently it weighs in at approx. 4
MB (compared to a full IDE download at approx. 110 MB). The cost, of course, is
that the Buckminster product is mostly unusable by itself. However, it does
contain enough to allow it to use the Update Manager mechanisms to install in
itself the requisite features. So by just pointing it at relevant update site
locations, it can become more powerful. Actually, in principle it should be
possible to upgrade it sufficiently to become the IDE&hellip;</span><br>


<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><br>


The product only contains the Headless aspect of Buckminster and is the
same as what is possible to install in the IDE, so any documentation
are the same. The main difference for the product is that it needs to
be customized to adapt to your situation.<br>


</span>
<h3>Customizing the product.</h3>




<p class="MsoNormal">Roughly, there are four things you need to do to customize a product for your team, say.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#Downloading_the_raw_product">Download the raw product</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Initialize_it">Initialize it</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Configure_it">Configure it</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Pack_it_updeploy_it">Pack it up/deploy it</a></li>
</ol>
The object in step 4 is to produce a zip package that can be downloaded
by team mates and just unpacked and be 'ready to go'. An alternative
would be to deploy it to a network location, again 'ready to go'.<br>
<h4><a name="Downloading_the_raw_product"></a>Downloading the raw product</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Similar to downloading a full Eclipse IDE
packaging, getting
the Buckminster product is similar &ndash; download a zip archive and unpack
it
somewhere convenient. See <a href="packaging.html">here</a> for a location.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Normally, it will be stored in a top level
directory
called &lsquo;buckminster&rsquo;. So for the rest of the text, let&rsquo;s assume that
you
have unpacked it to &lsquo;c:\buckminster&rsquo; on a Windows platform (again, it
should
work similarly on a Unix/Linux platform). You can add the directory to
the PATH, but here I will assume that you work in the root of the
'buckminster' directory.</p>
<h4><a name="Initialize_it"></a>Initialize it</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A difference from an Eclipse IDE installation is that there
are technical reasons making it difficult to correctly include a &lsquo;buckminster&rsquo;
binary in the top level directory. Thus, there is a separate step that has to
be run the very first time (obviously, this is later intended to be hidden
behind a more traditional &lsquo;install&rsquo; procedure if necessary).</p>
Thus, you must first run the following command:



<pre>c:\buckminster\_productinitializer initialize</pre>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Assuming there are no other problems, this will typically
open a new shell window and report how and where to set your path etc, and a
note on &lsquo;INITIALIZE OK&rsquo;. Just press Enter to dismiss the window. You should now
have the necessary buckminster binaries placed as they should.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>NOTE: As this procedure itself uses regular Eclipse
infrastructure, it requires a workspace as a side effect. To avoid having the
infrastructure automatically creating one willy-nilly, the initialization
procedure creates the workspace as &lsquo;_productinitializer.workspace&rsquo; in your home
directory. After the initialization is done, this can be deleted, it will never be used again.</p>
<h4><a name="Configure_it"></a>Configure it</h4>
Configuring your product essentially consists of installing the proper
features/plugins into it. This can be accomplished by using the
commands associated with the update manager mechanism:
install/uninstall/listsite. <a href="sample%20configuration.html">Here</a> is a sample showing how I configure a Buckminster product with higher order Buckminster features and required Eclipse features.<br>




<p class="MsoNormal">Note: working with this is helped by some
knowledge of how Eclipse works - particularly if you get into problems,
for example having unfulfilled dependencies. An important tool in these
cases can be the command 'dumpinfo' which will give an insight into
what features/plugins are installed/recognized/running etc.<br>
In case of problems: either look for a log file in the
&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata directory or in the products &lsquo;configuration&rsquo;
directory. Especially disconcerting can be the fact that some problems can
result in an invocation of buckminster&hellip;and nothing seems to happen (the command
prompt just returns). Typically, the Eclipse core framework has then logged an
error in a configuration log. A common occurrence is an unfulfilled dependency.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, many features makes the
product bloat quite a lot due to their not being enough finegrained.
And, there is no API way of deploying just plugins at this point. An
advanced technique is to further prune this
size by manually removing plugins not needed. Obviously, this can be a
trial
and error progress if you are removing plugins somewhat blindly and as
noted
above you may need to be aware of where to look for clues. Only
recommended if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<h4><a name="Pack_it_updeploy_it"></a>Pack it up/deploy it</h4>
Once you are done and feel your product customization is complete, a
typical action is to zip it up. Anyone can then just unzip it in a
convenient location and start using it - it is completely
self-relocating thanks to the Eclipse/OSGi infrastructure (just like
the IDE).<br>
