Buckminster offers functionality and/or integrations pertaining to many
activities that are useful to reach in scripted situations, for example
invoking 'build'. Such activities are frequently necessary to run in
situations where a user is not available, or even in situations&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">where
it&rsquo;s not possible to use a graphical user
interface. Thus,&nbsp;Buckminster recognizes the need to provide a way
to do these things from the command line. This will come in handy in
situations such as for automated nightly builds, for example. In
Eclipse
parlance, this is typically referred to as &lsquo;running
headless&rsquo;.<br>

</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">So,
to accommodate headless interaction with
Buckminster, Buckminster contains a&nbsp;framework to interact with
various
aspects of it from the command line. This framework is really general
purpose,
so like many other aspects of Buckminster (and Eclipse in general, of
course)
it is extension based, thus making it easy to plug in new commands to
work
seamlessly together with existing. In fact, if you wish to make a
headless application and populate it with your own commands only, you
can do that. </span><br>
