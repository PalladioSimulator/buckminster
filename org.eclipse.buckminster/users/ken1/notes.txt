================
NOTE:
This is just a bunch of anything I come to think of, notes of todo's, musings
on how to do things etc. Don't trust what's in here, it's just for my own use.
================

* Forking a VM in the launcher hangs at exit
* Try to avoid forking if possible
	- capture --vmarg -Dfoo=bar flags and just enter them in sysprops
* PerformManager: allow passing a list of actions to run
* reintro of headless defaults
* bugzilla: 117668, 129134, 129135, 129822, 129933, 144589
* the bucky prefs should be possible to set in config scope also
* the repository handlers should indicate MT aware (in order to fix the issue with the separate CVS client impl that isn't) 
* actions: TODO's
* actions: automatic build triggering
* actions: 'Real' performers (e.g. Make etc)
* Diverse TODO's i PerformManager
* Funderingar kring diverse synkroniseringsaspekter (framförallt intressant då/om/när vi stoppar in automatiska performs baserat på förändrade artifacts)
* how to invoke the product wizard in script?
	what else should be extpointed??? default cmdline? default cmd namespace?
* what's the most used name: 'update' or 'updates'
* does the docs work (let alone there's nothing in there)
* do something with the web site
* allow the doc extension point to be recursive
	- Sample: 'Users guide' contains 'Getting started'
* preferences
	- Think about rmap update processes
* cmdline
	- add a 'help text formatter'
		- can html be easily rendered to plain text and fixed width?
	- -version (print all version info it knows)
	- what's a minimum commandset? possibly a very simple 'build' command
		- what's the interface?
* general
	- how can we express a dependency on the users platform?
	- help users make sure their repository locations are accessible
* p4
	- preferences
	- interaction materialization/wizard

add the functionality to be able to 'team update' all projects, regardless if
they are from different providers...
