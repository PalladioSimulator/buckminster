<h2>Walkthrough of Buckminster component resolution</h2>
<p>This chapter explains how Buckminster will resolve a component request,
either in the form of an URL or listed as a requirement in a 
<a href="cspec.html">Buckminster Component
Specification</a> (henceforth referred to as the cspec) by using a <a
	href="#Resolver_Map">Resolver Map</a> into something that is <a
	href="#Materialization">materialized</a> on disk and optionally <a
	href="#Binding">bound</a> into an Eclipse workspace.</p>
<h3>Components and usage based requirements</h3>
<p>Buckminster views a component as a versioned artifact that can be
used in several different ways. To build it, generate docs from source,
to package, test, or deploy are all examples of different ways to use a
component. Buckminster also recognizes that component may morph into
many different shapes (artifacts) that reflect its evolution from pure source to
pre-built artifacts and even to a deployed binary that is up-and-running.</p>
<p>A component artifact may or may not fulfill a component request. It all
depends on the intended usage. A prebuilt binary cannot satisfy a
request to edit the source but it may be the perfect choice if the
intent is to just use it as part of a build.</p>
<p>Components have dependencies on other components. Such dependencies
can be qualified with a purpose. The purpose can help decide what shapes
of a component that can fulfill a dependency.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A developer of component <b>A</b> must be capable of editing the
	component source. If <b>A</b> is dependent on component <b>B</b>, the
	developer must at least have a precompiled version of <b>B</b> but if a
	<b>B</b> can be found that contains both a precompiled jar file and a
	zipped source, that might be ideal since it would support all needs of
	the component developer for component <b>A</b>.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A QA engineer that tests component <b>A</b> prefer a precompiled
	and packaged version of <b>A</b> and all of its dependencies. In
	addition, QA needs to deploy the component in a test harness. This
	might add several new dependencies to <b> A</b> that the developer
	normally would not care about.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Pre-built binaries and test results that reflect that some
	predetermined quality threshold has been reached might fulfill the
	requirements to create a public release of the CD. Hence, creating the
	CD is an action that has specific requirements.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An installer will require a packaged component and an environment
	where the component can be deployed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resolving a request</h3>
<p>Buckminster uses the name of the component as input to a <a href="rmap.html">
resolver map</a>. In return it gets a <a href="rmap.html#Search_Path">search 
path</a> that contains a sequence of <a href="rmap.html#Provider">providers</a>. 
Each provider is queried if it can instantiate a
<a href="rmap.html#Component_reader">component reader</a> that will be able to 
materialize a component that fulfills the request. Finally, all candidate 
readers are compared and the best match (or first in case matches cannot be 
distinguished) is selected. The task of comparing the matches is performed by the 
<a href="rmap.html#Version_Converter">version converter</a>. The component is 
then <a href="#Materialization">materialized</a> on the local disk if and 
optionally <a href="#Binding">bound</a> to a project in the Eclipse workspace.</p>
<p>To materialize and bind a component is not always enough to fulfill a 
component request. Consider a request for a pre-built artifact that is fulfilled 
by a component that is in the shape of source. The component cspec exposes an 
action that compiles the source and that action has to be triggered before the 
requestor can use the component as intended.</p>
<p>During resolvement, The user may qualify component requests further
by expressing an intent to make changes to the components. Such an intent
will often rule out all sources but the versioned repository that
contains the the component source.</p>
<h3><a name="Materialization">Materialization</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of why a component is materialized, i.e. regardless of the
purpose of the component request, a component is always materialized in
its entirety. Buckminster support inner components, i.e. components that
are materialize inside of other components (this is typically useful for
Eclipse plug-in components that make use of precompiled jar files that
are not plug-in aware).</p>
<h3><a name="Binding">Binding</a></h3>
<p>It is often desirable to bind a materialized component to the Eclipse
workspace. A component can be bound as a project or as a link in a <a
	href="#Proxy_project"> proxy-project</a>. It is often unnecessary to
bind external precompiled binaries. Components that are in the category
of installed software especially (such as the plug-ins bundled with the
Eclipse installation).</p>
<h3><a name="Proxy_project">Proxy project</a></h3>
<p>A <i>proxy project</i> is a project that is created on the fly.
It&#39;s purpose is to make components that are not Eclipse projects
available in the Eclipse workspace without having to change the content
of the project as such. A proxy project contains a project descriptor
with Eclipse-style links to the root artifacts of the contained
component.</p>
