<title>Buckminster Resolver Map</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Buckminster Resolver Map</h2>
<p>Each Buckminster installation will utilize a <i>resolver map</i> (an XML 
document) that will map the name of a requested component to one of several <a href="#Search_Path">
search paths</a>. The resolver map contains a list of pairs with a regular 
expression and a corresponding entry that is either the name of a search path or 
a pointer to another resolver map. The name of the requested component is 
matched against the regular expressions and the first match found denotes the 
search path to use or a redirection to another resolver map. When the latter 
happens, the mapping process is delegated to the other resolver map.</p>
<p>A resolver map also contains at least one <a href="#Site">site</a>
declaration.</p>
<h3><a name="Site">Site</a></h3>
<p>Since a resolver map is meant to be shared among many Buckminster users, a 
site acts a grouping of properties that is specific to some arbitrary group. A 
developer specifies his or her site by setting a Buckminster preference. A good 
example of a site-specific property is a URL that denotes the closest mirror of 
an archive. A geographically spread development organization can maintain one 
resolver map and still have all offices use optimal archive mirrors when 
fetching artifacts.</p>
<h3><a name="Search_Path">Search Path</a></h3>
<p>A search path is a named list of <a href="#Provider">provider</a>
declarations that will be traversed in order. A component name will be mapped to 
exactly one search path. A failure to find a matching search path is considered 
an error since without it, there's no way to find the component.</p>
<h3><a name="Provider">Provider</a></h3>
<p>A provider is a declaration that groups information needed to obtain a 
component of a specific type from a specific location using a specific 
versioning scheme. The information in the provider is used to create and 
configure a <a href="#Component_reader">component reader</a> that is associated 
with a <a href="#Component_type">component type</a> and a
<a href="#Version_Converter">version converter</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Component_type">Component type</a></h3>
<p>A&nbsp; component type knows how to extract dependency information from a 
component. Buckminster introduces a native type that contains a 
<a href="cspec.html">Buckminster Component Specification</a><i> </i>(cspec for 
short). It also have built-in types for update-sites, features, plug-ins, and 
fragments that will produce a cspec from the Eclipse provided manifest files.</p>
<p>New component types can be added using the extension-point <i>
org.eclipse.buckminster.core.componentTypes</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="Component_reader">Component reader</a>.</h3>
<p>Buckminster connects to a component using a <i>component reader</i>. A reader 
performs three significant tasks:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It can list component branches and/or tags that corresponds to a 
    <a href="walkthrough.html#Query">query</a>.</li>
	<li>It can read individual files from a component and thus support a <a
		href="#Component_type">component type</a> in gathering the information 
    needed to recursively create a dependency graph.</li>
	<li>It can materialize the component on the local disk.</li>
</ol>
<p>A reader will typically adapt to some specific type of source code control 
system such as CVS, Subversion, Perforce, or ClearCase but it can also be an 
adaptor for Maven repositories, FTP archives, or software that is installed on 
disk. One example of the latter is the &quot;eclipse-installed&quot; reader that will 
connect to components (in this case - features, plug-ins, and fragments) that 
are present in your Eclipse installation.</p>
<p>Regardless of type, the reader must have the following information in order 
to connect.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Repository URI (specified by the <a href="#Provider">provider</a>).</li>
	<li>Component name.</li>
	<li>A <a href="cspec.html#Version_selector">version selector</a> with an 
    associated <a href="cspec.html#Version_comparator">comparator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The component name and version selector both stem from the original component 
request. They will typically be specified in a component dependency of a
<a href="cspec.html">cspec</a>.</p>
<p>Once a reader has been instantiated, Buckminster will create a
version query based on the comparator, the rule, and a branch selector.
The reader uses this query when it obtains candidate component versions.
The query might result in several candidate versions so the next step is
to compare those matches with each other to figure out the best match.</p>
<p>The task of comparing the matches is performed by the 
<a href="Version_Converter">version converter</a>. Since it knows what
part of the branch selector that reflects the plain component version
(branch name or qualifier) it can apply the 
<a href="cspec.html#Version_comparator">comparator</a> correctly . It can also
determine the semantics that controls the interpretation of 
<a href="cspec.html#Match_rule">rules</a> and when comparisons are at all possible.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The rules <i>Equivalent</i> and <i>Compatible</i> cannot be used
	when comparing timestamps or sequential change numbers but the rules <i>Perfect</i>
	or <i>Greater or Equal </i>makes perfect sense.</li>
	<li>Comparing tag based version selectors that reflect different
	branches is probably not a good idea.</li>
	<li>Comparing different branches when the branch qualifier differs is
	equally bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>New types of component readers can be added using the extension-point <i>
org.eclipse.buckminster.core.readerTypes</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="Version_Converter">Version Converter</a></h3>
<p>Buckminster delivers two converters by default. One that will create
a branch selector that reflects the latest version on a branch named
from the plain version, i.e. &quot;3.1.0&quot; will be translated into
&quot;3.1.0/LATEST&quot; and one that will use the plain version as a
tag on the default branch. i.e. &quot;3.1.0&quot; will be translated
into &quot;main/3.1.0&quot;. Regular expressions can be used when less
straight forward mappings are desired such as &quot;3.1.0&quot; into
&quot;main/v3_1_0-xyz&quot;. It is required that the mapping can be
reversed without loss of information.</p>
<p>Aside from the component name and version selector, a component
request also contains a <a href="cspec.html#Version_comparator">version comparator</a>
and a <a href="cspec.html#Match_rule">match rule</a>.</p>
<p>New version converters can be added using the extension-point <i>org.eclipse.buckminster.core.versionConverters</i>.</p>
