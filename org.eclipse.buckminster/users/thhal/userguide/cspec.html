<h2>Buckminster Component Specification</h2>
<p><i>You need stuff to do things -&gt; To perform an action you must fulfill its 
requirements.</i></p>
<p><i>Others may regard the things you do as stuff they need -&gt; An action can 
produce artifacts that fulfill requirements of other actions.</i></p>
<p><i>You need stuff for a reason -&gt; There is always a purpose behind a 
component dependency. </i></p>
<p>Buckminster views all components in terms of a Component Specification, 
henceforth referred to as &quot;cspec&quot;. A cspec is
either obtained using a cspec builder or exists as a physical file in
the component that it defines. Buckminster delivers cspec builders for Eclipse
update-site&#39;s, features, plug-ins, and fragments. New builders can
be added as needed (see <a href="rmap.html#Component_type">Component type</a>).</p>
<h3>CSpec elements</h3>
<p>A cspec defines the four top-level elements <i>artifacts</i>, <i>dependencies</i>,
<i>actions</i>, and <i>usages</i>.</p>
<p>An <i>artifact</i> is a named collection of files and/or folders.</p>
<p>A<i> dependency</i> consists at least of a component name. The dependency may 
optionally contain a <a
	href="#Version_selector">version selector</a>, a <a
	href="#Match_rule">match rule</a>, and a <a href="#Version_comparator">
version comparator</a>.</p>
<p>An <i>action</i> is something that can be executed. It can have zero or many
<i>requirements</i>. A requirement can be either <i>local</i> or <i>external</i>. 
A <i>local </i>requirement states that an <i>artifact</i> must be present in the component. 
An <i>external </i>requirement names another component together with a <i>
purpose</i>. The execution of an <i>action</i> will often produce a new <i>
artifact</i>. </p>
<p>A <i>usage</i> can have zero or many <i>requirements</i> of the same kind as 
an <i>action</i>. A <i>usage</i> fulfills the <i>purpose</i> of a <i>requirement</i> 
from an external <i>action</i> or <i>usage</i>. In other words, it defines the 
components participation in an <i>action</i> defined elsewhere. A <i>usage</i> 
may <i>imply</i> another <i>usage</i> of the same component.</p>
<p>A dependency graph is always implicit since dependencies appoint other 
components and all components can be viewed in terms of a cspec. This implicit 
graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).</p>
<h3>Purpose qualified dependency</h3>
<p>When an <i>external</i> requirement of an <i>action</i> or <i>usage</i> is 
present, a <i>dependency</i> to the component that it names must also be present 
in the same cspec. An <i>external</i> requirement qualifies a <i>dependency</i> with a <i>
purpose</i>. A <i>dependency</i> that has no <i>purpose</i> will be ignored. The
<i>purpose</i> says &quot;I need this component in order to &lt;purpose&gt;&quot;. Here's an 
example:</p>
<p>Assume that we have three Java components, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>.
<b>A</b> use classes present in <b>B</b>. <b>B</b> in turn use classes from <b>C</b> 
but hides this completely from <b>A</b>. When compiling <b>A</b>, a compiled 
version of <b>B</b> is needed but there's <u>no need for <b>C</b></u>. When 
running <b>A</b>, clearly both <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> will be needed.</p>
<p>Object Oriented methodology tells us that it would be bad if <b>A</b> needs 
to know about the runtime dependency from <b>B</b> to <b>C</b>. It would be much 
better if <b>A</b> can say &quot;I need <b>B</b> in order to <i>compile</i>&quot; or &quot;I 
need <b>B</b> in order to <i>run</i>&quot; and <b>B</b> could answer, &quot;You need me in 
order to <i>run</i>? Then I need to bring <b>C</b> along as well&quot;. The purpose 
qualified dependencies resolves this elegantly.</p>
<h3>Artifact and derived components</h3>
<p>A component will always contain at least one <i>artifact</i>. A source 
component from a CVS repository will always contain the artifact &quot;source&quot;. This 
artifact is typically one single folder. Different actions such as &quot;compile&quot; or 
&quot;archive&quot; can produce new artifacts. It is often beneficial to store such 
artifacts in repositories and offer them as alternatives to the source when a 
component needs to resolve its dependencies. An FTP or HTTP based repository 
that stores pre-compiled binaries is a good example of this. In Buckminster 
lingo, such a binary is a <i>derived component</i>. It will contain a cspec 
similar to the one bundled with the original source pruned from the actions that 
produced the binary. The pruning will limit the component usage as well of 
course.</p>
<p>Since pruning removes actions and usages, some dependencies might end up 
purposeless. Such dependencies will be pruned too.</p>
<h3>Variability</h3>
<p>Buckminster allow artifacts to be <i>variable</i>. Variability is achieved 
through <i>artifact attributes</i> and by actions that can produce artifacts 
attributed in different ways. A trivial example of this is a compiler that can 
compile the same source, either stripped and optimized (distribution), or with 
symbols and not optimized (for debug purpose). Rather than having two artifacts 
and two actions (and two of every required artifact, etc.) attributes can be set 
in the outmost action that will be propagated all the way.</p>
<p>A attribute can be set in the artifact declaration or stem from the action 
that produces the artifact. The initial artifact of a cspec is never variable 
since it does not stem from an action. The more derived an artifact is, the less 
variable it becomes. A pre-built binary is typically not variable at all.</p>
<p>If an artifact defines that an attribute stems from the producing action, 
then that action must somehow provide the attribute. It can do this either by 
declaring that it is the originator (such as a compiler using attributes to 
control command line options) or by propagating it to at least one of its 
required artifacts and/or dependencies. It may also add new attributes to its 
requirements and/or dependencies.</p>
<h3>Names of actions and artifacts</h3>
<p>Buckminster does not stipulate the names of artifacts but here are some 
examples:</p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li><i>source</i><br>
  no associated action, this is often an initial artifact.</li>
  <li><i>compiled</i><br>
  produced by the action <i>compile</i>, requires the artifact <i>source</i>.</li>
  <li><i>docs</i><br>
  produced by the action <i>generate-docs</i>, requires the artifact <i>source</i>.</li>
  <li><i>archived-binary</i><br>
  produced by the action archive, requires the artifact <i>compiled</i>.</li>
  <li><i>archived-docs</i><br>
  produced by the action <i>archive-docs</i>, requires the artifact <i>docs</i>.</li>
  <li><i>archived-source</i><br>
  produced by the action <i>archive-source</i>, requires the artifact <i>source</i>.</li>
  <li><i>distribution</i><br>
  produced by the action <i>distribute</i>, requires the artifacts <i>
  archived-binary</i>, <i>archived-docs</i>, and sometimes <i>archived-source</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sample purpose names:</p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li><i>compiling</i><br>
  The original action is <i>compile</i>.</li>
  <li><i>linking</i><br>
  The original action is <i>link</i>.</li>
  <li><i>running</i><br>
  The original action is <i>run</i>. </li>
  <li><i>testing</i><br>
  The original action is <i>test</i>. This purpose would imply <i>running</i> 
  and add artifacts specific for testing.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Version_selector">Version selector</a></h3>
<p>A version selector can be either a plain version such as
&quot;3.1.0&quot; or it can be a branch selector consisting of a branch
name and qualifier. A plain version is always converted to a branch
selector before it is passed to a component reader. A component reader
will only understand branch selectors. The conversion from plain version
into a branch selector is performed by a <a href="rmap.html#Version_Converter">version
converter</a>.</p>
<p>A branch selector is qualified in one of four ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Latest</b><br>
	Denotes the latest revision on the branch. Notation:
	&lt;branch&gt;/LATEST</li>
	<li><b>Tag</b><br>
	Denotes a specific tag on the branch. Notation
	&lt;branch&gt;/&lt;tag&gt;</li>
	<li><b>Change number</b><br>
	Denotes a specific change number on the branch. Notation
	&lt;branch&gt;#&lt;number&gt;</li>
	<li><b>Timestamp</b><br>
	Denotes a specific point in time (UTC) on the branch. Notation
	&lt;branch&gt;@yyyy-MM-dd[THH:mm:ss]. The delimiters are all optional
	except for the &#39;T&#39;.</li>
</ul>
<p>A version selector that does not contain a &#39;/&#39;, &#39;#&#39;,
or &#39;@&#39; is considered a plain version and hence, those characters
cannot be used in a plain version selector.</p>
<p>A reader defines a <i>default branch</i>. For CVS that will&nbsp; be
&quot;head&quot;, for SVN it will probably be &quot;trunk&quot;,
ClearCase will use &quot;main&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>A <a href="rmap.html#Component_reader">component reader</a> that connects to
an non versioned artifact will only understand the notation &lt;default
branch&gt;/LATEST. A reader that cannot combine branch with tag (such as
Subversion) will use &lt;default branch&gt;/&lt;tag&gt; to denote a tag
and &lt;branch&gt;/LATEST to denote a branch (those notations are the
most common even when branches and tags indeed can be combined).</p>
<h3><a name="Version_comparator">Version Comparator</a></h3>
<p>The comparator knows how to compare two plain version selectors based on a <a
	href="#Match_rule">match rule</a> that specifies how stringent a match
must be.</p>
<p>New version comparators can be added using the extension-point <i>org.eclipse.buckminster.core.versionComparators</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="Match_rule">Match rule</a></h3>
<p>The rule may be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>None</b><br>
	Version matching does not apply, i.e. anything goes.</li>
	<li><b>Greater or Equal</b><br>
	Interpretation is comparator specific. A typical interpretation might
	be: The major tokens must be greater or equal. If they are equal, the
	minor tokens must be greater or equal, if both major and minor tokens
	are equal, the service token must be greater or equal, i.e. 1.2.3 would
	match 3.2.1 but not 1.2.2</li>
	<li><b>Compatible</b><br>
	Interpretation is comparator specific. A typical interpretation might
	be: Major tokens must be equal. The rest of the version must be greater
	or equal, i.e. 1.2.3 would match 1.3.5 but not 1.2.2 and not 3.2.1</li>
	<li><b>Equivalent</b><br>
	Interpretation is comparator specific. A typical interpretation might
	be: Both major and minor tokens must be equal. The rest of the version
	must be greater or equal, i.e 1.2.3 would match 1.2.8 but not 1.2.2 or
	1.3.0.</li>
	<li><b>Perfect</b><br>
	The match must be perfect.</li>
</ul>
