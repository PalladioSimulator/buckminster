This feature contains the mailapp.product file that is used to create the product.
A .product file is similar to a feature in that it groups (defines) required content, but it also
adds product specific information.
To simplify the setup - the .product file includes a single feature; the feature it is placed in.
This way the definition of what to include is "delegated" to the feature.xml.
